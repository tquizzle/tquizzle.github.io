I have to admit, I don&#8217;t always follow all of these rules&#8230;but for the most part I do. Since email communication is quickly replacing the way a lot of people communicate with each other, its best for everyone to learn the proper way of utilizing the technology.  
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://labnol.blogspot.com">Amit Agarwal</a> lists ten, but I&#8217;d like to add two more to the list:

*   Do not over use or under use punctuation. If you want to ask a question, there is no need for three or more question marks. A single ? will suffice. Same rule applies for those folks who like to make something more important by adding !!!!!! to a sentence.
*   Use proper capitalization. I know writing in all lowercase characters is quicker, but if you know how to type then you&#8217;ve learned about the *Shift* key. Use it. Don&#8217;t be lazy.

10 Tips for Better Email Communication

*   If you are sending an email to multiple people, put their email addresses in the BCC field and your own email address in the To: field. No one likes to share their private email address with strangers.
*   The email subject should be detailed enough to give the recipient an idea about the email content without having to open it. Single words like &#8220;Hi&#8221; or &#8220;Hello&#8221; or &#8220;Help&#8221; are a strict no-no. Think of meaningful but short titles.
*   Do not attach large attachments in your email since not everyone is on a broadband connection. If you have to send a large file over email, upload it to services like Yousendit and then pass on the link in the email. 
*   If you have to email more than two documents as attachments, zip them in one file. Doing so would ensure that your friend won&#8217;t miss downloading any file. 
*   Do not write an email while you are drunk or in a really bad mood. It would reflect on the style of your writing. 
*   Do not request a Read Notification Receipt. 
*   Always reply to emails especially the ones specifically addressed to you. The sender is still waiting to hear from you. 
*   Keep you email message short and to the point. Sentences like &#8220;I hope this email finds you alive and well&#8221; look good only in letter correspondence. 
*   Do not hit the Send button without doing a spell check. An email with spelling mistakes or grammatical errors indicate that you have written the message in a non-serious mood and may convey a bad impression. Always read the message before broadcasting it to the world. 
*   You may want to remove your personal mobile number and the home number from the email signature if you are participating in a big mailing list. You never know the kind of people who have subscribed to that list.
