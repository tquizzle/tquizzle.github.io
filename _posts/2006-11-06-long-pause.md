&#8230;at least that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m calling it to keep my spirits up.

I noticed a few weeks ago having lost of problems with my hands and wrists hurting. After about an hour or so on the computer I&#8217;d start complaining to whomever would listen.

I promptly went to the Employee Health Department, but I sort-of feel that they treated me as a faker. I didn&#8217;t realize how many &#8220;false&#8221; worker&#8217;s compensation claims that they see every week. That doesn&#8217;t make me feel that much better, but I digress.

Few visits later, the pain was only worse and I was ordered to see a specialist.

After some uncomfortable tests it was confirmed that I have carpal tunnel in not one, but both wrists! Whoo!

Luckily, it&#8217;s not exactly bad enough at this point for surgery and really the brunt of my problem is the tendonitis that I&#8217;ve developed on the back sides of my hands&#8230;but it is still uncomfortable. Hopefully these huge pills I have to take along with some PT will prove to be the best method for dealing with it now.

This has forced me to purchase some ergonomic devices and really take a close look at how I sit while working. It&#8217;s hideous and maybe this problem will help me to fix some of these ergonomic issues.

It&#8217;s also nice to have good voice recognition software. This thing has been a God-send. I&#8217;ve sent emails, wrote papers even browsed the Internet with my favorite Firefox.

Now that I&#8217;m starting to feel a little better, my updating can only get better.
