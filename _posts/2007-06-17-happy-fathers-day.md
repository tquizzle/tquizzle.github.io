And I&#8217;m finally ready to air it out.

The epitome of a fighter, my dad proved to our entire family that you have to be strong in the face of adversity. When the first round of chemo didn&#8217;t do the trick, he didn&#8217;t give up. And even after the second, third, and fourth rounds&#8230; he never gave up. In his five-year battle he even went face to face with total body irradiation and ultimately bone marrow transplant.

After a long, hard battle with the disease his body was unable to take any illness and with one fail swoop of pneumonia his ability to fight it off was completely gone. He passed away on May 21st of this year.

And even though I&#8217;m grasping for words to express what I feel, I can&#8217;t think of anything better to think about.  
Love you Pop. I&#8217;ll make you proud.<br clear="left" />
