`The following is a paid review.`

BuyMMOAccounts.com (BMMOA) is a new site out there for all you WoW players who are looking for an edge. They have a 100% account guarantee of the account you purchase so you can count on your purchased character to be legit. Check them out: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.buymmoaccounts.com">buy WoW account</a>.

While the buying and/or selling of MMO accounts is a direct violation of the World of Warcraft Terms of Service, if you&#8217;re willing&#8230;they will provide. They also have a &#8220;real&#8221; security guarantee; that when you purchase your account, they provide you with all the data you need to protect your account. 

Please note: There really is no way to prevent your new account from being &#8220;reclaimed&#8221; by the original owner but, BMMOA is the best there is when it comes to reclaim rate. They&#8217;re the lowest I could find at 1.2% of accounts ever being reclaimed and boast a 95% success rate of returning any compromised accounts back to the original owner.

> *   If your World of Warcraft account is found to be compromised by the original owner at any time during the life of the account we will do everything possible to return that account to you. If we are unable to return your account to you, you will be compensated with a new account of equal or greater value of your choice from our large inventory of accounts.
> *   If your World of Warcraft account is found to be disabled by Blizzard Entertainment for a non-negligent act of your own at any time during the life of the account we will do everything possible to have the account re-opened. If we are unable to return your account to you in fully working condition, you will be compensated with a new account of equal or greater value of your choice from our large inventory of accounts.

Do you have any questions regarding this process? No problem, check the website or call toll-free and someone will assist you. They have email, phone and even live chat support. How&#8217;s that for service?

So, say you have an account that you don&#8217;t use&#8230;or would like to dump to make some quick cash. BMMOA is available for that too. They&#8217;d love to purchase your account for top dollar. Simply fill out the form, wait to be contacted with a quote, then follow the directions. Leery about that? Concerned that they might rip you off? Have a lawyer fax them an agreement for the purchase of your WoW account and they&#8217;ll promptly sign and return it. Why would they go through that trouble? Because they want you to be comfortable selling your accounts online with them.

So, if you&#8217;re hunting for a good WoW account&#8230;point your browser to BuyMMOAccounts.com
