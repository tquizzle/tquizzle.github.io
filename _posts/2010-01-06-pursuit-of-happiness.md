The pursuit of happiness is something this nation knows all about. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of it is what every American wishes to obtain. Unfortunately, I believe that a lot of Americans arenâ€™t happy and/or canâ€™t find a path to happiness that suits them and their needs. Itâ€™s so unfortunate that in the land of plenty, few are genuinely happy.

In ancient times, the people of the world didnâ€™t have a lot of the things that we have today and ultimately take for granted. Even though the Bible and our history books have taught us that these ancient people werenâ€™t always happy, they seem to have gotten by just fine. So apparently, the things that the human race has created over time havenâ€™t made us any happier. Sure, these things were made for our conveniences, and some really do help us out, but they havenâ€™t succeeded in elevating our level of true happiness or created any more time for us. And certainly our happiness hasnâ€™t decreased due to lack of things, or even lack of money.  

  
### Cause of Unhappiness

Have you ever stopped and wondered what some of the overall causes of our unhappiness are? I think at the root of our overall unhappiness is that we are just not satisfied with what weâ€™ve accomplished. Itâ€™s the &#8220;Tomorrow Syndrome&#8221; of always wanting more or always wanting to achieve that next level has made us unable to enjoy the things that we have now. Not that achieving big things in your life is wrong, it just seems as if weâ€™re never satisfied with it. This leaves us thinking that maybe we are not where we would like to be, spiritually, professionally or in life, or maybe we just donâ€™t have what we thought we would have.

We are also victimized by the &#8220;Yesterday Syndrome.&#8221; This is evident in those who are always wishing they could change the past; always wishing they could redo something. Like they could somehow live the Butterfly Effect, or have a time machine and change everything bad to good. Those who are trapped by this, I feel, are often those caught up in a midlife or identity crisis trying to relive some of the days of old or to regain their childhood that maybe they didnâ€™t get to live out. You simply cannot live &#8211; truly live, like this.

### Stepping Up | Changing

Changing the way we think and live is the only way to find happiness in our lives. The only way to do that is to savor all of your todays. &#8220;So donâ€™t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Todayâ€™s trouble is enough for today.&#8221; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:34&#038;version=NLT">Matthew 6:34</a> Donâ€™t try to predict what tomorrow might bring&#8230;no one on this earth knows what tomorrow has in store. &#8220;This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.&#8221; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20118:24&#038;version=NLT">Psalm 118:24</a> There is absolutely no guarantee of tomorrow so enjoy the things today with all that God has allowed you to have. It&#8217;s a gift.

Weâ€™ve all heard this clichÃ©, but you have to enjoy the trip as well as look forward to the destination or youâ€™ll end up missing out on what could be a tremendous experience. Take the time to look around, notice the flowers, and take in the aroma of a fresh rain. You may find it newly exhilarating to pause, reflect, marvel at God&#8217;s creation and take a deep breath all-the-while reminding yourself that breath itself is spiritual. &#8220;Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground. He breathed the breath of life into the manâ€™s nostrils, and the man became a living person.&#8221; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%202:7&#038;version=NLT">Genesis 2:7</a> On the contrary, youâ€™ll find it quite depressing if you wait until tomorrow to realize you had or could have had a good time today.

### The world can give you nothing, God gives everything

You also canâ€™t count on the things that are outside your means to try to attain happiness. Many of the things of this world cannot truly make you happy; the kind of real happiness that we all seek. This includes money, clothes, cars, etcâ€¦ Donâ€™t be afraid to once and for all lay down the proper priorities for your life and for your family, but most importantly, put God at number one and **live by them**.

Everyone has possibilities, opportunities and talentsâ€¦thatâ€™s part of what being human is about. Therefore do what you can do when you can with what God has given you. This involves being productive at the talents that God gave you, finding your *spiritual gifts*, accepting them, and *helping others* with that gift humbly.

### Go Get It!

For happiness to affect your life, itâ€™s impossible to run from those problems youâ€™re facing. You have to confront them head on. You have to introduce the elephant in the room. In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%206:2&#038;version=NLT">2 Corinthians 6:2</a> the apostle Paul said, &#8220;Now is the accepted time&#8221;, so if you want happiness, do whatâ€™s necessary **now** to get it. You canâ€™t sit on the sidelines of life in a constant pattern of sitting on the bench waiting to be called to join the team; you must be responsible for your own spiritual &#038; physical well-being right now.

True happiness also comes with companionship. Most people arenâ€™t truly happy without some sort of companionship in their lives; we need others in and around our life to make it fulfilling&#8230;family, friends, church, etc&#8230; But, that kind of **real**, fulfilling, enjoyable happiness comes when you find one thing. That one thing is Jesus Christ. He is the key to the Pursuit of Happiness. Once you&#8217;ve found this, everything else seems to find new meaning.
