So the past few days have prove quite interesting.

It started off with me starting to feel bad on Friday and just escalated from there. All weekend I felt like crap, forcing me not to go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thegatheringtulsa.com">Church</a> on Sunday and missing both Monday and Tuesday of work. 

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://photos.tquizzle.com/2009/06/hot-day-for-the-car/"><img alt="" src="http://i0.wp.com/photos.tquizzle.com/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=293%2C160" title="Hot Car!" class="alignright" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>To make things just a bit more exciting, I got to have another root canal on Monday afternoon. After that, I was in a great mood! Jumping into the car, and forgetting that the A/C in the car wasn&#8217;t working properly, this is image is what my reality was.

Also on Monday, the A/C unit on my renter&#8217;s house stopped working. In the thick of the Oklahoma heat, this is no good. I started calling around to local A/C places to find out that they couldn&#8217;t come out and look at it until like Thursday or Friday. Obviously, I couldn&#8217;t expect my renter to wait that long so then came the favor calls.

I ended up calling a friend of a friend, and it paid off big time. He was able to get it up and running at 3am. Yeah&#8230;that&#8217;s right. This dedicated guy came over to my rent house at midnight and didn&#8217;t leave until 3am. What a guy! All was good, until&#8230;

The next day, during the hottest part of the day too, it failed again. This time, all the refrigerant had leaked out due to a bad valve and they&#8217;re back to where they were&#8230;hot as hell in the house. Another call, lots of freon, lots of sweat from my renters coupled with their patience; and its cold and working again.

Hopefully it will stay that way.
