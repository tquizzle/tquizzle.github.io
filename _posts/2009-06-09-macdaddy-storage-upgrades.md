I love my MacBook. In all reality, itâ€™s still @justinshattuckâ€™s MacBook, but Iâ€™ve actually had it for over a year.

Heâ€™s a great guy to give his buddy one of his MacBookâ€™s that he wasnâ€™t usingâ€¦especially since at that time I wasnâ€™t a Mac enthusiast. That all changed last February when I got a call from @justinshattuck that he wanted me to come over and look at some stuff we were going to be starting to work on. During the course of this conversation, I was offered this glorious piece of hardware and absolutely fell in love with it.

Now I understand what Mac enthusiasts have claimed all alongâ€¦thereâ€™s just nothing that compares to using a Mac. Itâ€™s sleek, its sexy, it works (almost ALL of the time) without reboots, memory leaks, etcâ€¦ It just works!

I will admit it was hard making the switch after being a career-long PC user, but after about a week or twoâ€¦there was no turning back.

#### Upgrades

After just a few months, I ran into a problem with the MacBook. It had a small hard drive. It was only 60GB, and thatâ€™s not near enough for a digital packrat like myself. After suffering long months, and constantly moving things back-and-forth to make enough space to do whatever it was I needed space to doâ€¦I finally sprung for a new hard drive. Luckily, these are easy to swap out.

Iâ€™ve got instructions & pictures of how to swap out a MacBook hard drive after the jump.

To swap out a hard drive, it really doesnâ€™t take much time or effort. Just some finger crossing and relying hard on your previous backups. The route I chose isnâ€™t the only way to restore data, but it worked out beautifully for me.

Here are some thingâ€™s youâ€™ll need:

*   Coin
*   Phillips screwdriver (#1) if possible
*   Torx (T-8) driver
*   Patience

Here we goâ€¦

1.  Shut it down and wait for a little while for the internal components to cool downâ€¦
2.  Unplug everythingâ€¦
3.  Flip it over and use the coin to release the battery  
    [<img title="Remove the battery" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tquizzle.com/uploads/2009/06/image-thumb.png?resize=244%2C165" alt="image" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]
4.  Once the battery is removed, touch a piece of metal inside the case to discharge any static electricity.
5.  Remove the three screws  
    [<img title="Remove the screws holding in the &quot;L&quot; bracket" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.tquizzle.com/uploads/2009/06/image-thumb1.png?resize=244%2C156" alt="image" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" />][2]
6.  Pop that â€œLâ€ bracket out. Your hard drive is on the left-hand side.
7.  Slide the old hard drive out using the nifty tab.

8.  Remove the little case that surrounds the hard drive using your Torx T-8â€¦and add it the same way to your new drive.
9.  Now, just the reverse of the above directionsâ€¦
10. Put the new drive in and tuck its tab underneath it.
11. Replace the â€œLâ€ bracket  
    [<img title="image" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.tquizzle.com/uploads/2009/06/image-thumb3.png?resize=244%2C149" alt="Put the &quot;L&quot; bracket back in" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" />][4]
12. Put the battery back in & boot up with the OSX install DVD.
13. Got to Utilities > Disk Utility and format the new drive to the appropriate specifications you want.
14. Restore your old data whatever way you chooseâ€¦

There you go&#8230;you&#8217;ve now replaced your old hard drive with a new one. I went from a 60GB to a 500GB.
