Since Internet access costs $12.99 per day and I was trying to enjoy myself while trying to not spend time in email and recording thoughts, I felt the need to jot down a few thoughts on the recent trip to Las Vegas.

### Day 1 &#8211; Long Day

Today was filled with cramming a few extras into the suitcases my wife made me pre-pack the night before as well as preparing myself for a 2.5 hour flight. I&#8217;m not a good airplane passenger, and this experience wasn&#8217;t terrible. With the exception of being a large man in coach, it wasn&#8217;t too bad.

After touching down, the night was filled with grabbing a few drinks and food items. It&#8217;s always nice to enjoy exceptional food in a nice restaurant and an early night after a long, long day.

### Day 2 &#8211; Tired &#038; Scored

This morning started fun until I realized after an entry fee, and another rebuy, that today wasn&#8217;t my day for poker. I just couldn&#8217;t get any decent cards and the blinds were killing me.  
Lunch at the Buffet at Mandalay Bay was pretty nice and after a long afternoon walking the South Side of &#8220;The Strip&#8221; we headed back to home base, aka The Luxor and took a much needed nap.  
Now it&#8217;s off to some &#8220;nighttime&#8221; fun.

### Day 3 &#8211; Think this will be easy&#8230;think again

Today started by sleeping in a little and enjoying some nice cuddle time. It was extremely nice to do since by day 3 we hadn&#8217;t really enjoyed this.

I think today I walked 45 miles (at least my feet are telling me that distance is correct). We walked all over the strip, back and forth, forth and back again.

The work at this shop is sensational. I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of nice tattoo shops in Vegas, but the wife (a research buff) decided that this one was the best. During the tattoo and upon leaving, we were not convinced otherwise.

Off to the Venetian for the Blue Man Group we headed after hailing a cab from the corner near the tattoo parlor. The Blue Man Group was everything I heard it would be. Very interesting and intriguing. The wife&#8217;s not a huge audience participation person, but even she got into it. It was very visually and audibly stimulating.

### Day 4 &#8211; Another Try and Chill

This morning I tried another attempt at a No-Limit Hold&#8217;Em Tournament and very close to Day 2&#8242;s attempt, I got nothing but crap cards therefore couldn&#8217;t really make a decent go at the table&#8217;s chips. Oh I tried&#8230;and failed, but I enjoyed myself playing Hold&#8217;Em in Vegas with tons of other folks from out of town.

Nothing too much else happened&#8230;just a little buffet action! I just wish I could feel like I get my money&#8217;s worth.

### Day 5 &#8211; Heading Back to the Shack

No breakfast, no anything&#8230;just a shower and preparing for the shuttle ride back to the airport. We had some mis-communication between us and the shuttle company whom for the record shall remain nameless, but they go by &#8220;CLS&#8221; which almost caused quite the problem. We called 24 hours before we were to leave (like we were supposed to do) and after being transferred three times to three different people that didn&#8217;t know how to make a shuttle reservation, we finally got one scheduled for 9:15am. When the driver didn&#8217;t show by 9:30, my wife called to check. &#8220;It&#8217;s not my fault mam, someone should be there. Were you out front on-time?&#8221; Are you serious? A company&#8217;s policy that lays blame on the customer without even the consideration that they may be at fault in some way, should be closed. Screw &#8216;em.

Ride home wasn&#8217;t bad. Just had an old couple behind us that of course had to talk loud the whole way home. Glad I had iTunes and some headphones to drown them out.
