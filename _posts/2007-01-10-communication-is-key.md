I have been struggling with writing about this topic for quite some time. It seems like when I am more personally affected by a lack of communication between myself and friends, family, coworkers, etc. I get more and more frustrated. I think what bothers me most is that I&#8217;m guilty of this too but when it happens to me, I don&#8217;t like it.  

### The Problem

The problem sounds fairly easy and simple, but actually I think it&#8217;s quite difficult to explain. When someone gives you a specific time or a block of time that they will be calling, chances are that you&#8217;re waiting for that call. It&#8217;s not so much that you have nothing better to do during that time, but that time could have been used for more productive things. That time becomes the &#8220;wasted&#8221; past, and there is no way to get it back.

I think it comes down to verbal communication etiquette, or what I will call &#8220;V-com etiquette&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think I even have to explain this, it&#8217;s something easy if you take a few moments and think about it. It&#8217;s as easy as googling &#8220;verbal communication etiquette&#8221; and reading a few pages.

I have noticed in my own personal sphere of influence that this tends to occur more in gen-Y&#8217;ers than other generations. Why is this? Have we become so reliant on technology for reminders that we don&#8217;t even remember personal verbal obligations or time frames? Are we so mindless that we adopt the &#8220;you should&#8217;ve reminded me&#8221; attitude as to shift blame away from ourselves for forgetting? What does this say about how we feel about our friends, family, etc.? Are we just too busy?

### The Reflection

Of course I hate to admit it, but I do it to friends and family, although when it&#8217;s done to me I get frustrated with them quickly. Is this fair, oh hell no, but it&#8217;s honest.

For me, it&#8217;s less about you having the answer I&#8217;m looking for or information I&#8217;d like to discuss and more about simple, common courtesy. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m petitioning for something that my sphere of influence cannot give me. I take people at their word&#8230;probably to a fault. And I think that&#8217;s why it bothers me when I do this to other people. I think about that, and feel that when I don&#8217;t come through for someone, or reply, call back, etc. when asked to do so; I am damaging our relationship unintentionally by giving the recipient reason to doubt me and my word. And personally, I don&#8217;t want to live with that anymore.

### The Solution

Easy to write down, hard to implement&#8230;but I am attempting to do this, and am challenging everyone with whom I converse at least on a weekly basis, to do the same.

*   Write notes to yourself, for yourself, maybe even on yourself (This is especially important when you tell someone &#8220;I&#8217;ll call you right back&#8230;&#8221;)
*   Field calls quickly and get to the point as soon as possible
*   Indicate to caller or &#8220;communication starter&#8221; that you are busy and may or may not be able to return the communication in a timely manner. This is the epitome of common courtesy.
*   Return voice mails as soon as you hear them so that you don&#8217;t forget to call them or what their voice mail was about. 
*   Excuse yourself when making or accepting cellphone calls in the presence of others
