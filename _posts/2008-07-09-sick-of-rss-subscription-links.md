You know what I&#8217;m sick of?

It&#8217;s those small, but annoying boxes bloggers are putting in their blog content that says something to the effect of:

<div style="padding:5px;border:1px dotted #ffffff;margin: 10px auto;">
  <strong>&#8220;Looks like you&#8217;re new here. Why don&#8217;t you consider subscribing to my <span style="color:#FF9933;">RSS</span> feed?&#8221;</strong>
</div>

If I want to subscribe to your feed, I know what to do. I&#8217;m kinda smart. If you&#8217;re content is so engaging that I can&#8217;t NOT subscribe (double-negative I know, but it helps the point), then I will&#8230;but its not because you suggested it. Its because you&#8217;re site has &#8220;*RSS Staying Power*&#8221; (new term I just coined). Its because I can learn something from your site and enjoy the way you communicate ideas and knowledge. Not because you want me to.


But begging me to subscribe or sliding a request box into your content is not the way to win my subscription. It only annoys the crap out of me.

Maybe I&#8217;m flying off the handle here, but this sort of thing bugs me. I understand the need for subscribers, especially if you have a semi-prominent blog and count on the readers to fuel your ad revenue. Readership is great, but does it really show you something? Really?

I tend to think that readership is skewed. That the actual number of &#8220;real&#8221; readers who take the time to read your site, are not represented in the number of RSS subscribers you have. A lot of people who take the time to subscribe simply will not check your site again, or it will fall into their group of &#8220;hardly read&#8221; articles in their feed reader of choice. I would venture to say, and I could be way off here because I don&#8217;t have some &#8220;super set&#8221; of data to base this off of, but I think you should take your readership numbers and multiply it by 65%. That should land you a more &#8220;accurate&#8221; number of real readers.

I too am guilty of this. I grab a feed thinking that I will enjoy it later, only to find out that maybe it was just a fluke. Maybe that particular day I was impressed with what I found, but later reads proved to the contrary. It was not a blog that had RSS Staying Power. Thus, when I got tired of seeing it, it got deleted.

So do me a solid, you three people who actually read my site&#8230;remove this ridiculous block of html if you&#8217;re a blogger and have it. You probably dont want these &#8220;every once-in-a-while&#8221; readers anyway. If you don&#8217;t want to remove it because you think it increases your RSS subscribership numbers, then move it out of the main content section of your articles. How about on the sidebar where it belongs?
