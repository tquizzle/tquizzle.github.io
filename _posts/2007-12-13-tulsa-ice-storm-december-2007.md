There were at one time almost 800,000 customers in Oklahoma without power. In December, that&#8217;s not a good thing.

<img class="alignright instant" src="http://i2.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2230/2101166345_f8900c5be9_m_d.jpg" alt="Ice Storm - Dec 2007" data-recalc-dims="1" />We&#8217;ve been without power since sometime around 2am Monday morning. Since the in-laws have a gas generator, we&#8217;ve been staying in their house where the furnace is running at a good 71&deg;.

Working at a hospital proves difficult in these times too because a lot of businesses are closed down due to their own lack of power therefore their work force is at home taking care of business. The hospital never closes and we have our own quite complex power generator backup system so we&#8217;re still expected to be at work shining brightly.

One thing this whole experience has taught me is to always carry a lighter in your pocket. Never know when you might need to light a candle.

With heaps of people without power, you actually have the audacity to not only enjoy your heat, but to gloat about it by &#8220;Clark Griswold&#8217;ing&#8221; your neighborhood.
