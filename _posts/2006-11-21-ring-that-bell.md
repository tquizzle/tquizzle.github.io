As a somewhat proud person, especially of my family, today was an amazing day.

Today my nephew David got to ring a bell he has wanted to ring for the last few years. This bell in particular is extremely exciting to hear ring. This bell&#8217;s ringing signifies that for the time being he is leukemia free. All the children who ring this bell, have this amazing feeling.

My family has been waiting for this day for quite some time. To witness this young boy be excited about completing treatment solidifies the power of the human spirit and is a testimony to his strength in character and strength over physical hardships (much stronger than mine). It&#8217;s amazing, the power of the human body, especially in youth. The ability of the young body to heal and be healed is nothing short of amazing.

David&#8217;s strength, will power and spirit has forever changed him and his family.

Thank God for his <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.saintfrancis.com/locations/nwbcc/clinic.aspx">amazing doctors, nurses</a>, drugs and family support. Without each one of these, his success would have been much more difficult to realize.
