I really don&#8217;t like conflict. I don&#8217;t necessarily avoid it like the plague, but I do not enjoy having conflict in my life. Whether it be personal or professional, and for the most part, I just wish everyone could always get along.

> 1.  Be impeccable with your word.
> Words have immeasurable power, so use them with care. Say only what you mean, and remember your opinion isnâ€™t fact. Silence is better than saying something youâ€™ll regret.
> 
> 2.  Donâ€™t take anything personally.
> Here Iâ€™ll quote the book, â€œNothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves.â€ That guy honking at you just spilled scalding coffee all over his lap, the boss screaming at you is going through a divorce. Their stuff has nothing to do with your stuff, and assuming youâ€™re the root cause of someoneâ€™s behavior is not only self-centered, itâ€™s also a big waste of energy.
> 
> 3.  Donâ€™t make assumptions.
> You can spend hours generating theories about why someone did something, or you can just ask. When someone lashes or does something unexpected, save time by seeking clarification.
> 
> 4.  Do your best.
> Do the best you can with the conflict in front of you, and you wonâ€™t need to waste brain power on self-judgements or regrets.</ol> </blockquote> 
> I see where she&#8217;s going with this and these are definitely things I need to keep in the forefront of my mind during daily dealings with people.
